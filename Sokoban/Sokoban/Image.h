// The Image class is a wrapper around the Texture2D class.  It holds
// important information about an image that can be rendered to the screen 
// such as its dimensions, rotation, scale, color filter and texture coordinates.
// The texture coordinates allow an image to respresent a subimage within 
// the texture which then provides support for sprite sheets (texture atlases).
// 
// To effect rotation, 
// translation and scaling, this class transforms this images own matrix.  This 
// allows us to load the transformed vertices into the IVA so that they are rendered 
// correctly based on the images scale, rotation and location.
//
// If an image is not rendered using the ImageRenderManager then the rendering is 
// the responsbility of another class.  In that instance the images rendering
// details such as geometry and texture information can be retrieved using 
// the images ImageDetails structure
//
