// This class is responsbile for rendering all Image content to the screen using
// OpenGL.  Each time an image is asked to render it calls the render manager
// which takes a copy of the images TexturedColoredQuad informaiton and loads
// it into the render managers IVA.
//
// This information is then used to render the images when the renderImages method is called
// Each texture on the queue is rendered in turn which means all images that use the same 
// texture get rendered together.  This reduces the number of texture binds that are necessary.
// Side effects are that using multiple textures can make it difficult to get the ordering of
// where images are rendered on the screen correctly.
